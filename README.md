io-wraps-usatoday-php
=====================
v0.5 - PHP wrapper for USA TODAY Articles and Census API.

Unpack this package into a directory at the "htdocs" level on any
web server stack with PHP. The references to the dependences are
all relative.

1. The three functional PHP examples are articles_headlines.php,
community_feed.php and census_population.php. These are live
examples, not the libraires. To see how the libraries are used,
just peek at the source.

2. Add your key to these source files to make calls. Both 
articles_headlines and community_feed will use your USA TODAY
Articles API key. census_population will require your USA TODAY
Census API key.

3. Navigate to articles_headlines.php, community_feed.php and
census_population.php from your browser and give it a whirl.

Requirements: Any standard LAMP stack. PHP requirements are
the regular suspects. Please report any dependency issues along
with a stack bio (OS, server, etc.).
